# RubyGg

RubyGg is a league api wrapper gem that handles the API end points of the league of legends.

It is programmed to wrap the API END POINTS in trouble-free manner to get the data from league api. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_gg'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_gg

## Usage

Create new instace of the Client:
```ruby
    client = RubyGg::Client.new(api_key, region)  
    # api_key is your league_api_key and region is the region you want.
```
Get list of challenger players
By default paramater passed in is zero (which returns back all 200 challengers).
However you can pass in interger or string of an integer to get set number of results (1-200 or it'll return all 200).
```ruby
    client.challenger.solo_queue(100) # This returns 100 challenger players.
    client.challenger.solo_queue('100') # This does same thing.
    client.challenger.solo_queue # This returns all 200.
    client.challenger.solo_queue(iamidiot) # This will still return all 200.
```    
Gets summoner information (for data types check league api documentation). returnType is hashValue.
returnType = {:user => {userDto}, :solo => {soloDto}, :flex => {flexDto}, :tt => {ttDto}}
```ruby
    client.summoner.get_user(id) #Where id can be int or str. 
    You can check for id from client.challenger.solo_queue()[0][:playerOrTeamId] # Gives the id for first challenger player in the list returned.
```
